  <dt id="email_address">Who gets to see my email address? <a href="#email_address">#</a> </dt>

  <dd><p>We will not disclose your email address to anyone unless we are obliged to by law,
  or you ask us to. This includes the public authority that you are sending a
  request to.  They only get to see an email address
  @fyi.org.nz which is specific to that request.  </p>
  <p>If you send a message to another user on the site, then it will reveal your
  email address to them. You will be told that this is going to happen.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="nasty_spam">Will you send nasty, brutish spam to my email address? <a href="#nasty_spam">#</a> </dt>
  <dd>Nope. After you sign up to FYI we will only send you emails
  relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up for,
  or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never give or
  sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged to by law, or
  you ask us to.
  </dd>

  <dt id="public_request">Why will my name and my request appear publicly on the site? <a href="#public_request">#</a> </dt>

  <dd>
  <p>We publish your request on the Internet so that anybody can read it and
  make use of the information that you have found. We do not normally delete
  requests (<a href="#delete_requests">more details</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
  Your name is tangled up with your request, so has to be published as well.
  It is only fair, as we're going to publish the name of the civil servant who
  writes the response to your request.  Using your real name also helps people
  get in touch with you to assist you with your research or to campaign with you.
  </p>
  <p>It is recommended you use your real name for the request. See the next question for alternatives if you do not want to publish your full name.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="real_name">Can I make an OIA request using a pseudonym? <a href="#real_name">#</a> </dt>


  <dd>
  <p>The requirements for making an OIA request are fairly broad. Any person who <a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1982/0156/latest/DLM65382.html">is a citizen of New Zealand, a resident of New Zealand, or located in New Zealand</a> can make one.</p>

<p>However using an obvious pseudonym will probably make it impossible for you to complain to the Ombudsmen later about the handling of your request.  </p>

<p>There are several good alternatives to using a pseudonym.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a different form of your name. The UK experience is that that "Mr Arthur Thomas Roberts" can make a valid request as "Arthur Roberts", "A. T. Roberts", or "Mr Roberts", but <strong>not</strong> as "Arthur" or "A.T.R.".
</li>
<li>Women may use their maiden name.</li>
<li>In most cases, you may use any name by which you are "widely known and/or
is regularly used".
<li>Use the name of an organisation, the name of a company, the trading name of
a company, or the trading name of a sole trader.
<li>Ask someone else to make the request on your behalf.
<li>You may, if you are really stuck, ask us to make the request on
your behalf. Please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> with
a good reason why you cannot make the request yourself and cannot
ask a friend to. We don't have the resources to do this for everyone.
</ul>

<p>Please do not try to impersonate someone else.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="postal_answer">No no, they need a postal address to send a paper response! <a href="#postal_answer">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you want,
they may ask you for a postal address. To start with, try persuading them
to scan in the documents for you. You can even <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a scanner</a>, which in that particular case
embarrassed the authority into finding one they had already.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, and you want to provide your postal address privately
in order to receive the documents, mark your request as "They are going to reply by post", and it will
give you an email address to use for that purpose.</p>
</dd>

<dt id="delete_requests">Can you delete my requests, or alter my name?  <a href="#delete_requests">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>FYI is a permanent, public archive of Official Information Act requests. Even though you may not find the response to
a request useful any more, it may be of interest to others. For this
reason, we will not delete requests.
</p>

<p>Under exceptional circumstances we may remove or change your name
on the website, <a href="#takedown">see the next question</a>.
Similarly, we may also remove other personal information.
</p>

<p>If you're worried about this before you make your request,
see the section on <a href="#real_name">pseudonyms</a>.</p>

</dd>

<dt id="takedown">Can you take down personal information about me? <a href="#takedown">#</a> </dt>

<dd>

<p>If you see any personal information about you on the site which you'd like
us to remove or hide, then please <a href="/help/contact">let us know</a>.
Specify exactly what information you believe to be problematic and why, and
where it appears on the site.</p>

<p>If it is sensitive personal information that has been accidentally
posted, then we will usually remove it. Normally we will only consider
requests to remove personal information which come from the individual
concerned, but for sensitive information we would appreciate anyone
pointing out anything they see.</p>

<p>We consider that there is a strong public interest in
retaining the names of officers or servants of public authorities. We will only
remove such names in exceptional circumstances, such as where the disclosure of
a name and position of employment would substantially risk an individual's
safety. If you are such an official and you wish to have your name removed for
such an urgent reason, you must supply us with a request to do so from your
line manager. This request must demonstrate that a risk has been perceived
which outweighs the public interest, and must demonstrate that efforts have
been made to conceal the name on the organisation's own website.</p>

<p>For all other requests we apply a public interest test to decide
whether information should be removed.
We cannot easily edit many types of attachments (such
as PDFs, or Microsoft Word or Excel files), so we will usually ask
that authorities resend these with the personal information removed.</p>

<p>
FYI's administrators have access to unpublished data such as phone numbers and email addresses but will never use this information for any purpose other than the operation of the FYI service.
</p>
