    <ul>
      <li>The New Zealand Herald is providing hosting and technical support for the operation of the FYI.org.nz website. The Herald has offered this support because it believes that the Official Information Act is an important institution and that this website is a valuable public service.</li>
      <li>FYI is an Open NZ project, and run by volunteers independent of The New Zealand Herald. The Herald will never interfere in the operation and administration of the site or any OIA Requests made through the site, nor does the Herald prevent anyone from using FYI.org.nz</li>
